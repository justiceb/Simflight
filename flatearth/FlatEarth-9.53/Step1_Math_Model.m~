% OBJECTIVE: Develop the aerodynamic and thrust model for a particular aircraft.
%
% INPUTS: a file of basic vehicle constants, e.g. Basic_Constants.m
% OUTPUTS: In the Matlab workspace will be defined an array called constant.
% Note: memory is cleared at the start of this script.

clear all; close all; format short g
% Note that this code clears MATLAB memory
%                    and can clear time histories that may have been previously 
%                    generated by SIMULINK.

% Get the matrix of basic constants. Use the basic constants to compute the
% array called constant
Basic_Constants_MPX5;   %            <<<<< AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA FILE
%Basic_Constants_Team1; % Use this script to model the particular aircraft <<<<<
%Basic_Constants_Team2; % Use this script to model the particular aircraft <<<<<
%Basic_Constants_Team3; % Use this script to model the particular aircraft <<<<<
%Basic_Constants_Team4; % Use this script to model the particular aircraft <<<<<


% BasicConstants.m (or similar aircraft specific file) is called only once and this call is 
% in the statement above.
% If you change to another aircraft called NewAircraft
% you would be wise to change the names of file
% to something like this
%              Basic_Constants_Team2.m

disp(aircraft); % Display aircraft identification
Make_Constants  % Creates the array called constant used to define the 
%                 aerodynamics and mass properties of the aircraft.
disp(aircraft); % Display aircraft identification
Check_Constants % Check the constants for believability.
disp(aircraft); % Display aircraft identification
